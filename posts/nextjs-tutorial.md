This was one very interesting experience and a lot of new knowledge.

This relatively simple course covers a variety of Next.js abilities via developing a vercel-hosted blog, deploy included.

I can definitely recommend this tutorial, it requires around 10-15 hours to cover depending on your study speed.

While passing this tutorial there was an option to chellenge oneself with a dasic React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial with some extended functional in the end. This one was very interesting to study as well, especially the self-development tasks in the end.
