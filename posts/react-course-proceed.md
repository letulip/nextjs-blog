I was approved to get the full paid version of [Learn React Tutorial](https://react-tutorial.app/) and it's genuinely wonderful news!

This course has a fantastic PWA Quiz for a smartphone so one can practice theory during an off-computer time and it's very thoughtful and convenient.

BTW I fixed a bug in Starwars API implementation. The correct version can be viewed [here](https://letulip-nextjs-blog.vercel.app/starwars/)
