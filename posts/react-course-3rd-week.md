3 whole weeks have passed and now I can conclude that the course requires way more time and inner strengths to study.

I definitely obtained some understanding of core React functional such as states, props, and effects, and learned about first hooks as well.

My progress may seem a bit slow, but one should consider the great amount of knowledge given in the course, my motivation to proceed, and my effort to learn in the first place.

More to say - I started the Duolingo Deutsch course with intentions to support my son's English learning effort and to entertain myself as well.
